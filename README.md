I recently completed a detailed Power BI analysis of our global sales and profitability trends, highlighting some key insights:
1. Regional & Country Performance: The U.S. led in both profit ($207K) and sales ($1.3M), contributing significantly to overall performance, while Western Europe drove the highest regional sales with $762K.
2. Top Year in Sales & Profit: 2023 saw a sales peak at $2.19M, with November being the top month, while 2022 recorded the highest profit and profit margin, led by strong mid-year performance.
3. Customer Trends & Orders: 2023 had the most orders and highest monthly averages, with the U.S. accounting for nearly 20% of the customer base.
4. Segment Insights: The Corporate segment led in both sales and profit, achieving $3.84M in sales and consistently outperforming other segments from 2020 to 2023.
5. Product Categories: Body Care emerged as the top-selling category, with Nail Care and Herbal Essences Bio products contributing most to sales volume.
6. Profit Margins & Discounts: An inverse relationship was found between discount rates and profit margins, with large discounts (80%+) eroding profitability.
This analysis provided a clear picture of our growth drivers and challenges across markets, guiding strategic decisions for sustained performance.
